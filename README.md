# 🏭 ManuTrack for TextiFlow

### Data Analysis & Forecasting Project for Manufacturing Textile-Downtime, Reducing Downtime for Maximum Productivity.

---
---
## 📌 1. Project Idea & Executive Summary

The core objective is to leverage advanced **Data Analysis** to move beyond reactive maintenance by delivering a **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** of textile manufacturing downtime. We will synthesize **operational, human resource, and maintenance quality data** to develop **Predictive Models** capable of forecasting equipment failure and informing strategic decisions related to resource allocation and maintenance optimization.

**Ultimately, this project aims to maximize machine productivity and avoid critical failures to enhance overall production efficiency and increase the plant's profitability.**
